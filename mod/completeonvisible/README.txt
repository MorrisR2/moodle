The new "complete when visible" module can now be used to tie course completion to 
conditional activity rules.  Any set of rules that can be set in the "Restrict Access" section 
can be used for course completion.

To use it, add a "complete when visible" to the course.  

For the text, enter something like "Congratulations, you have completed the course."
Under Restrict Access, set up the rules which will indicate course completion. 
Under Activity Completion, set "student must view this activity to complete it".
Set the course to complete when this new activity completes.

The "complete when visible" activity will be marked complete as soon as it is visible and 
that will mark the course complete.
