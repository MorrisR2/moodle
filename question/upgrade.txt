This files describes API changes for code that uses the question API.

=== 2.6 ===

Changes to protected methods of class question_bank_view:

    Filters, including $recurse and $showhidden, are now implemented as
    pluggable question_bank_search_condition classes. 

    Therefore $recurse and $showhidden are no longer passed to the following functions:
        protected function display_options($showquestiontext) {
        protected function build_query_sql [deprecated, use build_query()]

    protected function display_category_form() is deprecated. Use question_bank_search_condition_category

    protected function display_category_form_checkbox is deprecated. Use html_writer::checkbox and separate Javascript
